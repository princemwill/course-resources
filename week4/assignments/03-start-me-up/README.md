## Details

Bootstrap can be used to get responsive web layouts developed quickly. In this assignment, you're going to build upon the work we did in class to develop a more fully-featured website for a fictional startup.

Look at other startup websites to get ideas for components to include. Your site should include multiple pages (or multiple sections on a single page), and it should look pretty cool. Imagine you want to convince some investors to give you some funding!

Some ideas for things to include:

- A navbar
- "User" testimonials
- Generic inspirational videos
- Corporate buzzwords
- Sharp-looking glyphicons
- Alerts

### Stretch Task

Make it interesting! Include more complicated things. Some possibilities:

- Videos/video backgrounds
- Parallax backgrounds
- Transitions/animations


## Hints

Try things! Make commits every time you get your page somewhere interesting, and play around.

Use Chrome's web inspector to fiddle around with CSS. You can even add classes from within the web inspector - try double-clicking on something if you'd like to change it.
